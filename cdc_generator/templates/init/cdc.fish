# Fish shell completions for cdc command
# Generated at runtime by Click shell completion protocol.
# This replaces the previous 735-line static completion file.
#
# How it works:
#   When fish needs completions, it evaluates this script.
#   Click outputs a completion function that fish registers.
#   Click delegates to shell_complete callbacks in
#   cdc_generator/cli/click_commands.py, which call the
#   same autocompletions module as before.
#
# To regenerate manually:
#   env _CDC_COMPLETE=fish_source cdc

eval (env _CDC_COMPLETE=fish_source cdc)
